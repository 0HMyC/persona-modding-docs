This site hosts guides and documentation to help you get started modding Persona games.

{: .info }
> Currently these docs focus on the main PC Persona games (P3P, P4G, and P5R) however this may be expanded in the future. 
> 
> Regardless, the way you edit files is often similar if not the same for other games.

{: .warning }
This site is currently **very** WiP so a lot of stuff will be incomplete. If you want contribute to it you can, it's all [open source](https://github.com/AnimatedSwine37/persona-modding-docs)!
