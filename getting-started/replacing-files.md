# Replacing Files

Now that you have [made a mod](making-a-mod) you can start replacing the game's files. There are two broad types of files which you will replace in different ways: **loose** files and **packed** files.

## Replacing Loose Files
Loose files are the simplest, they are *loose* in some folder in the game's files. 



## Replacing Packed Files
Packed files are a bit more complicated, they are inside of an archive file (think like a zip) which we call a PAK.

PAK archives can have many different file extensions like `PAK`, `ARC`, and `BIN` although they are all actually the same format.
