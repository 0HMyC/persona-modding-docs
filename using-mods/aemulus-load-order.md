In general your load order should not matter as most file types will be automatically merged by Aemulus, removing potential conflicts. 

{: .info }
> In Aemulus a mod that is **higher** in the list has a **higher priority**. So, if your mod is first in the list it would take precendence over everything else.

## Is My Load Order Right?

The easiest way to tell if your load order is good is to **play the game**. If you find that a mod isn't working then try these steps in order:
1. Check the mod's Gamebanana page. There may be known incompatibilities that are listed in the description or a comment.
2. Move the mod that isn't working to the **top** of the list so it becomes high priority then rebuild. If this works then you'll likely notice that a different mod breaks, in that case reach out to one or both of the authors to see if they can help make the two compatible.
3. Disable all other mods then rebuild. 
- If that fixes it, enable other mods a few at a time (building after each change) until you find which causes it to stop working. With that found, reach out to one or both of the authors to see if they can help make the two compatible.
- If it still doesn't work, ask for help in the [Persona Modding Discord server](https://discord.gg/naoto) or report the issue to the author directly.
